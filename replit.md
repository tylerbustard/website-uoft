# Overview

This is a full-stack web application featuring a personal portfolio website with an integrated SQL translator tool. The application showcases a developer's professional profile while providing a practical AI-powered feature that converts natural language queries into SQL statements. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as both a professional showcase and a functional tool for database query assistance.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a React-based single-page application (SPA) built with TypeScript and Vite for development tooling. The frontend follows a component-based architecture with:

- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming and responsive design
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and API interactions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas

The frontend is structured with modular components for different sections (hero, about, skills, experience, portfolio, contact) and a dedicated SQL translator component that interfaces with the OpenAI API.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js using TypeScript and follows a RESTful API design:

- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the primary database
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation for development
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for SQL translation and contact form submissions

The server implements middleware for logging, error handling, and development-specific features like Vite integration for hot module replacement.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a comprehensive storage approach:

- **Production Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database with Drizzle ORM for schema management
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for rapid development and testing
- **Database Schema**: Includes tables for SQL queries, contact messages, and user data with proper relationships and constraints
- **Object Storage**: Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage backend) for persistent file uploads (PDFs, videos) in production deployments
- **File Uploads**: Hybrid approach - uses Object Storage in production for persistence, falls back to filesystem in development

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently, the application doesn't implement user authentication as it's designed as a portfolio showcase. The storage interface includes user-related methods for future authentication implementation.

## AI Integration
The SQL translator feature integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o model:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts user input into SQL queries using a predefined database schema
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON responses with both SQL query and explanation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures and invalid responses
